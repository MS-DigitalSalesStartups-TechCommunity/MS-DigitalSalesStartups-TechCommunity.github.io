      <p class="scribe-step">18. Sizing the k8s nodes is important when considering EKS to AKS. The types of workloads and their usage will influence the choice of how many nodes and what node size we use for the cluster. It is also important to consider valid quotas for the migration.

AKS setup allows for 3 types of authentication and authorization: Local accounts with k8s RBAC, Azure AD authentication with k8s RBAC, and Azure AD authentication with Azure RBAC. One strength of AKS is its tight coupling with Azure AD to use Azure role assignments for authorization checks on the cluster.</p>

      <p class="scribe-step">24. Networking is very important when considering migrating from EKS to AKS. It is important to inventory the range of services and applications that uses them in the EKS cluster and then follow best practices for downtime handling. You might typically migrate over time rather than all at once, meaning old and new environments might need to communicate over the network. If an application previously used ClusterIP services to communicate, they might need to be exposed as LoadBalancer type and secured appropriately after the migration. Ideally, you want to point clients to new services that are running on AKS and we recommend that you redirect traffic by updating DNS to point to the Load Balancing sitting in front of your AKS cluster - Azure Front Door can direct customers to the desired k8s cluster and application instance.</p>

      <p class="scribe-step">33. Out of the box, we can enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud which provides unified security management and threat protection across the workloads - importantly when migrating production workloads we want to consider the security policies and protection against threats as we build in AKS. Using Defender backed with Azure Monitor and Azure Policy allows for threat protection, container insights, and at-scale enforcements and safeguards for AKS clusters in a centralized, consistent manner through Azure Policy.</p>

When migrating from EKS to AKS, we likely will have a set of images that are pre-built or need built for the new cluster; we can use tools like Azure Migrate to help with that along with connecting the AKS cluster to Azure Container Registry to store and use these images.</p>

      <p class="scribe-step">36. When migrating from EKS to AKS, it is important to know the type of data persistence and where the new data will be stored. When we create the AKS cluster, we have the option to enable secret store CSI driver which also allows us to integrate Azure Key Vault secrets. Ideally, when we migrate persistent volumes, we want to quiesce writes to the application, take snapshots of the disks, create new managed disks from the snapshots, create persistent volumes in AKS, update the pod spec to use existing volumes rather than static provisioning, then deploy the application to AKS, validate it and point live traffic to the new cluster. You can use tools like Azure CLI Disk Copy extension and Azure Kube CLI extension to migrate volumes between k8s clusters.</p>
