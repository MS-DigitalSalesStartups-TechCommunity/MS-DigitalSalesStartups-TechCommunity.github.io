      <p class="scribe-step">18. Sizing the k8s nodes is important when considering EKS to AKS. The types of workloads and their usage will influence the choice of how many nodes and what node size we use for the cluster. It is also important to consider valid quotas for the migration.

AKS setup allows for 3 types of authentication and authorization: Local accounts with k8s RBAC, Azure AD authentication with k8s RBAC, and Azure AD authentication with Azure RBAC.

      <p class="scribe-step">24. Networking is very important when considering migrating from EKS to AKS. It is important to inventory the range of services and applications that uses them in the EKS cluster and then follow best practices for downtime handling. You might typically migrate over time rather than all at once, meaning old and new enviroments might need to communicate over the network. If an application previously used ClusterIP services to communicate might need to be exposed as LoadBalancer type and secured appropriately after the migration. Ideally, you want to point clients to new services that are running on AKS and we recommend that you redirect traffic by updating DNS to point to the Load Balancing sitting in front of your AKS cluster - Azure Traffic Manager can direct customers to the desired k8s cluster and application instance.</p>

      <p class="scribe-step">25. In the network section, we can define and create a new virtual network. Both Azure VNet and AWS VPC segregate networks with subnets. Azure VNet assigns resources connected and deployed to the VNet a private IP address for the CIDR block specified and the smallest subnet supported is /29 and largest is a /8. Record the CIDR block range you need when migrating from EKS to AKS for k8s services and and the cluster as you do not want to experience IP exhaustion and also want to be able to scale accordingly.</p>

      <p class="scribe-step">33. Out of the box, we can enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud which provides unified security management and threat protection across the workloads - importantly when migrating production workloads we want to consider the security policies and protection against threats as we build in AKS. Using Defender backed with Azure Monitor and Azure Policy allows for threat protection, container insights, and at-scale enforcements and safeguards for AKS clusters in a centralized, consistent manner through Azure Policy.</p>

      <p class="scribe-step">34. When migrating from EKS to AKS, we likely will have a set of images that are pre-built or need built for the new cluster; we can use tools like Azure Migrate to help with that along with connecting the AKS cluster to Azure Container Registry to store and use these images.</p>

      <p class="scribe-step">36. When migrating from EKS to AKS, it is important to know the type of data persistence and where the new data will be stored. When we create AKS cluster we have the option to enable secret store CSI driver which also allows us to integrate Azure Key Vault secrets. Ideally, when we migrate persistent volumes, we want to quiesce writes to the application, take snapshosts of the disks, create new managed disks from the snapshots, create persistent volumes in AKS, update the pod spec to use existing volumes rather than static provisioning, then deploy the application to AKS, validate it and point live traffic to the new cluster. You can use tools like Azure CLI Disk Copy extension and Azure Kube CLI extension to migrate volumes between k8s clusters.</p>
